				<h1>Bali fun</h1>
				
				<p>I liked shopping in Bali. We went shopping in Ubud with Grandma and Grandpa. They wanted to buy us something nice. They bought me some bracelets - I got black, red and green. I wear them all the time. Mummy and Daddy say that I look like a proper traveller.</p>

				<p>On the way back from Ubud, we went to a monkey forest. That’s all Freddie wanted to do. We saw monkeys climbing on someone’s backpack. We didn’t know why they liked the bag so much until they pulled out loads of bananas. There were thousands of monkeys in the forest. Sadly a monkey bit someone so we were a bit more careful after that.</p>

				<p>Really close to our villa, there was a beach with black sand, because of the volcanoes on the island. There were enormous waves that sweep you out and don’t let you get back in. We liked jumping in them and Freddie liked running away from them. After playing in the waves, right next to it, there is a bar called Old Man’s which a lot of surf dudes go to. We went there every day and had a granita. Granita’s are drinks like ice cream. I liked mango but they had run out of mango so they had pineapple, lime and strawberry.</p>

				<p>I liked and I didn’t liked the outside toilet at our villa. I liked it because it was unusual and it was warm on the loo. I didn’t like it because there were mosquitoes there. We got bitten to death.</p>

				<p>On the way to the Tanah Lot temple,  we stopped to try some ‘poo’ coffee. I call it poo coffee because a Luwak eats the coffee bean fruit and then poos it out. They dry it and clean it and roast it. Then Mummy and Daddy drank it! Instead we had sweet potato coffee, coconut coffee, lemongrass tea and mangosteen tea. They were my favourites.</p>

				<p>In our villa, it was a bit strange because Mummy and Daddy had a double bed they shared. Freddie had a cot. Grandma and Grandpa had a double bed they shared. But me and Madeleine had a double bed each. We had our own room with its own telephone and own front door!</p>

				<p>In our villa, we had our own friendly chef to cook for us. She cooked kids' chilli, chicken satay and nasi goreng. I loved the the chicken satay best with its sweet sauce. We’ve never had our own chef before. It was very strange but I liked it.</p>

				<p>One of the team at the villa made creatures out of the napkins we had for dinner every night. He made hedgehogs, bunny rabbits, and lots of others. It reminded me of the towel genius from Dubai who made animals out of towels!</p>

				<p>In Seminyak Square,we got shirts that we called Beach Dude shirts. Me, Freddie and Madeleine were all matching. We wear them all the time, even to the beach. On the shirts are palm trees with a blue background. I like being matching with my brother and sister.</p>

				<p>I loved Bali. It is my second favourite place so far, behind Dubai.</p>
