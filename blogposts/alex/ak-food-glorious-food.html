				<h1>Food glorious food</h1>

				<p>On our first day in Beijing, we went to a famous Peking Duck restaurant (Jackie Chan has been there). The chef brought the duck to our table to carve it up. He has to make 100 cuts in one duck. We ate it in a wrap with cucumber, carrot, plum sauce. I loved it. We also ordered a dish of chicken and vegetables. Daddy didn’t think it was spicy so we fed it to Freddie but actually it was! Freddie cried straight away. We ordered some orange juice. Daddy didn’t know but it was a whole pint of orange juice.</p>

				<p>We also went to a hot pot, cook your own, restaurant. This was nowhere near as good as the peking duck restaurant. Daddy thought it looked it nice from the outside but I think he chose the wrong restaurant because all it sold was meat, meat and more meat. You had to cook the raw meat in a bowl of boiling chicken soup, on your table in front of you. I only ate one piece of meat. Everyone thought it was a disaster! After we went to an ice cream place for pudding - phew!</p>

				<p>One night we went to a food market. It was disgusting. They sold some of the most horrible food I’ve ever seen. There were scorpions (alive on sticks, ready to be fried), deep fried giant spiders as big as your hand, snake, shark, seahorse, squid, starfish, sea urchin, silkworm and crickets. We saw a person eat one of the scorpions - he said it tasted like chicken. You can’t eat most sharks now in China. They used to be so popular that everyone used to fish for them and now there aren’t many left. However, there was something I liked. Hawthorns saved the day! Hawthorns are sour but they are covered in honey. They look like mini red apples.</p>

				<p>Breakfast in our hotel is amazing. There are chocolate muffins, dried pineapple, the best yoghurt in the world, and I love the home made granola. They also have rice, noodles, pickles and congee (rice porridge). I never have any of these!</p>

				<p>Today it is Chinese New Year. There are a lot of red lanterns, a lot of fireworks and a lot of little oranges everywhere. We even bought a firecracker but unfortunately we couldn’t find anywhere to light it safely. There were police everywhere and we didn’t want to get in trouble. We were left four chocolate coins in a golden wrapper in a red envelope by the hotel. The colour red means good luck and wards off evil spirits.</p>

				<p>Overall, the food in China has been nice and bad, a mix of really tasty and food that I will never eat in my life.</p>
