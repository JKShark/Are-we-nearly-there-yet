				<h1>Kidzania</h1>

				<p>We went to Kidzania in Tokyo. This is a place just for kids where you can choose a few jobs for the day. When you get a job, you get paid with Kidzos. With these Kidzos, there is a shop you can go to and spend the Kidzos or you can pay to make things (like  ice cream which cost 10 Kidzos).</p>

				<p>My first job was being a pilot. We had to wear a pilot uniform and a woman taught us how to fly the plane. You didn’t actually fly a plane. It was like a computer screen and you had to fly an airplane through white and red circles on the screen and then land the plane. I was paid 7 Kidzos. It was really fun.</p>

				<p>Next, I did food R&D which was making new food. These are the ingredients: we did snowy rice, normal rice, bacon, chicken and sweetcorn. Snowy rice is very cold and it is like sand but white. We put all the ingredients in a box and heated it up. It tasted amazing.</p>

				<p>Then I worked in a bakery with my sister. Daddy said it smelled like croissants and he was right! We got a triangular piece of dough and rolled it from the big end to a small end so that it looked like a caterpillar. We had another piece of dough which was rectangular. We got a dough cutter. Folded the corner down and cut a little slice, unfolded it and put the right hand side underneath and pulled and put the left side above and pulled it, so it looked like a twisted piece of wood. We put them in the oven and when they were finished, we put some syrup on the top and we ate them. They tasted delicious.</p>

				<p>After the bakery, it was nearly time to go. I did making ice cream with Freddie. We had to pay. We had to wear an apron and a hair net and a stripy hat. We lined up with a cone in front of us and the lady told us how to do it. We twirled the cone underneath a machine that made the ice cream, like a pyramid. Then we added sprinkles and a biscuit. I had to help Freddie because he was too young. He really liked it.</p>

				<p>I liked having jobs as I have never had a job before and would really like them to open Kidzania in England so I can earn more Kidzos to spend!</p>
