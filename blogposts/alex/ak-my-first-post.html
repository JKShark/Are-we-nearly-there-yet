				<h1>My San Francisco trip!</h1>

				<p><em>Thursday 23rd October</em></p>
				<p>We flew on a plane to San Francisco. The seats were really cool because they turned into beds. There was a TV. The flight was 11 hours and we needed to sleep on the plane.</p>
				
				<p><em>Friday 24th October</em></p>
				<p>Today we went to a famous chocolate factory shop, Ghirardelli. My favourite was the dark chocolate. We went on a street car up a really steep hill and it was really fun. We went to a basketball match and I fell asleep. The Warriors vs. the Denver Nuggets.</p>

				<p><em>Saturday 25th October</em></p>
				<p>We went to a museum and we saw a white alligator and some snapping turtles. The alligator was as still as a statue. I bought some really cool trainers from the mall. We had Oreo, peanut butter and marshmallow cheesecake!</p>

				<p><em>Sunday 26th October</em></p>
				<p>We went to a park which had a squidgy floor and enormous slides. It had lots of good climbing and running places. Then we met my cousins Toby and Harriet for brunch. After, we went to the Exploratorium which is a museum with lots of cool experiments.</p>

				<p><em>Monday 27th October</em></p>
				<p>We went to one of the most famous prisons in the world, called Alcatraz! We went in one of the baddies' cells. We drove in a big car to our second hotel which was right next to the beach in Monterey Bay.</p>

				<p><em>Tuesday 28th October</em></p>
				<p>Today we went to a famous aquarium in Monterey Bay. We saw sharks, sea otters being fed, jelly fish and a huge octopus. We ran for miles on a sandy beach.</p>

				<p><em>Wednesday 29th October</em></p>
				<p>We went to a mystery spot, which had fallen down a hill. It was very hard to stand up in. We also went to a redwood forest with gigantic trees.</p>

				<p><em>Thursday 30th October</em></p>
				<p>We went to a pumpkin patch which had thousands of pumpkins. There was a hay bale maze which was really difficult.</p>

				<p><em>Halloween!</em></p>
				<p>It was so fun. We went trick-or-treating with our cousins. The costumes were amazing and all the houses were decorated. I was Iron Patriot.</p>

				<p><em>Saturday 1st November</em></p>
				<p>We went home...</p>
