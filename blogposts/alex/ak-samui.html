				<h1>My favourite things in Samui</h1>

				<p>Mummy asked us to wander around the hotel and to find our 5 favourite things. I went on my own with Madeleine. It was a lot of fun. These are my favourite things:</p>

				<p>1. The View</br>
					The view from the Thai restaurant is very beautiful - you can see for miles. The sea glistens in the sun, and the seaweed makes dark patches. Trees as tall as the sun crowd around villas, dotted here and there.</p>

				<p>2. The Staff</br>
					I like the staff because they say hello every time they pass me. Everyone knows our name, so they say things like "do you need a buggy, Alex?" when they pass us (buggies are little battery-powered golf carts that we use to get around the hotel, because it is on a steep hill). The staff are extremely friendly, kind and helpful.</p>

				<p>3. The Hotel</br>
					We are in the middle of a lush rainforest. There are buggies everywhere to take you around. There are lots of paths through the forest where you can explore. I LOVE this because we are allowed to walk everywhere without mummy or daddy. On our first night, we had dinner on the beach and watched someone juggle with fire and some local women dancing with 10cm long nails. We also watched a movie (Happy Feet 2) on the beach one night. The hotel had set up a giant white screen in front of sea with the movie projected onto it. We sat on sun loungers with some fresh popcorn. It was awesome.</p>

				<p>4. Kids’ Club</br>
					There are lots of fun activities like making pancakes and candles. We have decorated t-shirts, painted coconuts and played with all the toys there. It’s like being at a party.</p>

				<p>5. The Beach</br>
					I love the beach here, because it’s so close to our villa that we can go everyday. Sometimes we even go more than once each day and we make Smores (roasted marshmallows with chocolate sauce and biscuits) on the beach in the late afternoon. The sea is really clear so you can see where you’re going and it’s not murky and scary. The water is very warm because it is heated by the sun every day. There are even loads of toys to play with. We even borrowed life-jackets and flippers so we were allowed to swim out really far.</p>
