				<h1>The battle for control</h1>

				<p>My children are like most children, I assume. They're 80% good and 20% monster. And this works well. They show their good side at school and at sleepovers and with friends. They reserve their real selves, their animalistic, beating lizard brain for their quieter moments, with their parents. At least I wish they were quiet.</p>

				<p>In these moments our beloved darling kind sweet children (it could be any one of them) transform into strangers. Reality TV, rude, disrespectful strangers. And almost anything can begin the transformation. We've tried to discover the cause so as to block it off - the pathway to tantrum. Tiredness, hunger or frustration can definitely set them off. But not always.</p>

				<p>Schoolwork can usually be relied upon to begin the transmogrification. That feeling of not knowing something. Being helpless. Expecting yourself to know but not wanting to ask for help. It would appear to be part of the human condition. And they really hate that feeling. Their familiarity with us lowers the threshold for self control and explosions of frustration that wouldn't erupt at school rain lava down upon us from which there is no cover.</p>

				<p>Three months into our trip and we are not yet able to prevent this change. We've tried different methods. Praise, patience, understanding, shouting, punishment, reward. We've not yet found the solution. Has anyone else? (Answers gratefully received.)</p>

				<p>The one good thing about this is that the other two also transform simultaneously into angels. Kindness and helpfulness abound. As if the juxtaposition will earn them extra points, however transparent the ruse.</p>

				<p>I'm sure we're not alone. I really, really hope we're not.</p>

				<p>It seems to be about control. And winning. And defies logic. Nobody knows all the answers. Let alone young animals with no experience. Our job is to give them the benefit of our experience. To short cut the learning journey. To enable each generation to become better, faster than the previous one. But if that's the case, then why fight it? Why assume that you know everything when clearly you don't? (Doesn't stop my wife though! Ha ha). Why not accept all the help you can get and absorb the lessons quickly and then move on? It appears to be an evolutionary flaw. Experience can be handed down by stories. But those lessons need endless repetition to be learned. And without school, the repetition falls to us. And it's time consuming. And boring.</p>

				<p>And what is it about winning? Eliminating winners and losers from the world is pointless. My experiment of throwing my children into the unknown and watching them closely for 8 months has already provided some initial conclusions. They like to compete. For everything. Our affection. Getting dressed quickest. Running to the next palm tree. Getting into bed the slowest. Being the most annoying. Everything is competitive. Now, you may say that has just come from me. I'm never knowingly uncompetitive. And that may well have had an influence. But for the last year or so, that hasn't been me. And they are still the same. I would proffer that it's innate. Inbuilt. And we should encourage it.</p>

				<p>The battle for control is never won. It's ongoing. We are currently losing. But my competitive streak won't let me lose. Society won't let me lose. I am going to control these animals. My animals.</p>
