				<h1>Comfortable sofas killed the cat</h1>

				<p>I’ve led a pretty sheltered existence. Private school. University. Then London. A diverse city but not if you hang in your pack. Turns out the world is a big place. And we’re all different.</p>

				<p>But we’re all the same too.</p>

				<p>I’ve never really fancied travelling before. Been quite happy surrounded by my self. Or at least lots of friends like me. I guess that’s why they’re friends. I can’t wait to see them again too. That’s not what this is about. I just got to a point where I’d lost my curiosity. I didn’t want any new friends. I knew the world and I was happy with my version of it.</p>

				<p>But I’m not sure that’s healthy. There are a lot of people in this world. A lot of people to meet and talk to. And it’s fun. It really does unlock hidden sections of your brain. I’m not sure what would have happened if we hadn't taken off like we did. But change is now the new normal. And whilst it was a bit difficult at first, we just breathe it in now. The kids seem fine. They miss home occasionally but I don’t think they miss their stuff too much. We're all in this together. They just expect us to rock up at an airport every so often and go somewhere new. “New hotel?” as Freddie says. Yes indeed.</p>

				<p>We met a nice German family or two (hard to tell) in Samui. Swapped stories and anecdotes about children. They were intrigued by our trip (so much so that he even read my blog!!) and it made me realise that what we're doing is pretty unusual. We were told before we left that we’d meet loads of people on the same tour of Asia, dropping out of life to ‘chill’. But that hasn’t happened. It’s not that we’ve avoided any fellow travellers, it’s just that we have kids with us. That scares off the hippy, hardcore travelers. And any families with kids are back home going to school. Dropping out isn’t the right phrase. It feels like we’re dropping in. Diving in. Feeling the cool waters envelope us, shock us and make us feel more alive.</p>

				<p>We’re off to Bali today and our driver this morning (sounds grander that it was) was chatting about his family holiday to Bali last year. All the things he did and what he would recommend. And they're all the things we intend to do. We all have the same wants, needs and desires. A nice holiday in Bali is universal.</p>

				<p>We’ve finished the ‘difficult’ leg of our trip (note: I realise none of this is really difficult). Vietnam, Japan then China are tough places to be with kids. Hard to get around. Totally foreign. Alien even. But they were a blast. From here on, there is much more English spoken and we're in more normal travel territory. We're also leaving hotels behind.</p>

				<p>Hotels are great and I always thought I could live in a hotel as a cool rock star or movie star sometimes does. No washing up or cleaning or tidying. It’s all done for you. But you have no space. Rooms are generally tiny. No communal areas for the family to relax in or escape from. And you end up eating so much that you’d surely die young (maybe thats what rock stars are hoping for?).</p>

				<p>We are renting a house in Bali and then we are in AirBnB land, living in other people’s houses for most of the rest of the trip. More space. More like home. More like living. I’m looking forward to it. No doubt, I’ll miss the all you can eat buffet breakfast but maybe I can stop buying bigger and bigger clothes too.</p>

				<p>I wonder what Bali will be like. What adventure lies ahead? It’s nice to have uncertainty. We have no plans for the next two weeks. No expectations. Nothing to achieve. Let’s just get there and see what happens.</p>
