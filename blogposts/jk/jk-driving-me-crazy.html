				<h1>Driving me crazy</h1>

				<p>Some advice today - rare for this blog, I know. Don't. Drive. In. Bali.</p>

				<p>We were advised against hiring a car for our stay in Bali. But I didn't want to be house bound for two weeks. And we'd hired a car last time we were here (17 years ago). I knew things would have changed but surely not so much. I'm a good driver (like everyone else, I'm better than average). I could cope, surely?</p>

				<p>At the last minute I decided against it. I remembered how hard it was to find anything last time. In the time before sat nav. We given instructions from our hotel which included the line, "Turn left at the large Banyan tree". I still don't know what a Banyan tree looks like, and I certainly can’t classify them into tall, grande and venti. Safe to say, we got lost.</p>

				<p>So this time we have a driver. Sounds very grand. It's not. We have a knackered old Toyota that would be on the scrap heap in the UK (160,000 km and counting). It also only costs us $25 a day regardless how much we use it. That's less than one trip into central London back home.</p>

				<p>Our driver is called Benni but also Jackie (naming in Bali is odd and complicated and I haven't completely understood it) and has been awesome. Getting around without him would have been impossible.</p>

				<p>I'm not exaggerating. There are no road signs for a start. And I don't mean that the signs are poor. There are literally no road signs. And the roads themselves are cart tracks with (sometimes) tarmac on them. That means that they are so narrow that two cars cannot fit side by side, even on two way streets. Add in ditches either side of the road to allow the (usually heavy) rain water to drain away into the rice fields and you have the ingredients for multiple games of chicken, lots of reversing and lots of pulling in of wing mirrors.</p>

				<p>There is, however, one road which is even narrower. It goes through a beautiful rice field and is raised about a metre off the ground. It’s a secret road, only used by the locals and by bikes.</p>

				<p>Yeah, right. It's the busiest road we've been on as it cuts out miles. It's quite the short cut. But I hate it. I get stressed every time we turn into it. If a car is two metres wide, then this road is three metres wide. Wide enough for a car and (only just) a scooter. But we encounter 4x4s, trucks and pedestrians. And because of the drop each side, there is a real risk of your wheels dropping off the edge of the road. If this happened, the car would roll into the rice field and probably end up on its roof, even at slow speeds. It's the only place on the island where I've seen road rage, mainly from me.</p>

				<p>And don't get me started on the scooters. They're the only sensible way to get around here but most of the people riding them appear to be first timers. No balance. No control. No helmets. No wonder scooters are the biggest cause of casualties on Bali. Some of the riders are just kids too. As young as ten. Who is letting them out on the roads?</p>

				<p>The scooter-rider clan also have no patience whatsoever. It's as if they’ve got so used to their new found freedom, able to whiz about hither and thither, that whenever there is the slightest hold up in the roads (usually two cars playing chicken) they weave out and try and overtake the now stationary cars, causing an even bigger blockage because now we are trying to fit two cars and three scooters into the same narrow strip of tarmac. They just don't get it. Crazy.</p>

				<p>(As an aside, what is the point of wearing a helmet with the strap undone? If you crash, the helmet goes flying off and you die. Surely either wear a helmet or don't. There is no half way house).</p>

				<p>(Another aside, and some more free advice, don't undertake a car on a corner. Ever. I've seen the dangers in London, causing most of the cycle deaths on the road. They haven't learned the lesson here yet. But people keep dying, so they will).</p>

				<p>Changing tack, one of the coolest things we've seen as a mod for scooters is a welded padded frame on one side. What for? To carry your surf board to the beach of course. When we come back, I'm definitely getting one of them. Perfect for London.</p>

				<p>Until then, if you’re in Bali, get a driver. Pay him well. And stay safe (ish).</p>
