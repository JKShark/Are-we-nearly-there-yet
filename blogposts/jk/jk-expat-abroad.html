				<h1>An expat abroad</h1>

				<p>Nothing has changed. At least that's how it seems. 17 years fly by and here we are again. We were newlyweds then. Old haggard parents now.  Lan Kwai Fong was the destination then. Now the sofa's siren call is harder to resist.</p>

				<p>A short (international) flight from Shanghai and we hit Hong Kong. In the past 17 years everything has changed in Shanghai. Everything is new. Shiny communo-capitalism at work. Hong Kong seems a bit grubby by comparison. A reflection of how advanced it was then, perhaps.</p>

				<p>It's also a bitch to build anything new here. We're on the island and it is just a crazy place to live, to colonise, to build. A lot of the roads are over 10% incline. The one outside our apartment is 17%. That is hard to walk up, let alone get a crane up, dig a big hole, fill it with steel and concrete et voilà it's a high rise block of flats. But they do that. There are skyscrapers all over this rock. There are over 7,000 of them in Hong Kong.</p>

				<p>And they are all clustered together, trying to keep warm. It makes for an extraordinary sight. An amazing night time vista. And my children are excited here, perhaps more so than me (this is the first stop on our trip that I’ve been to before). They’re tired and over excited but not exactly sure why. Alex said it was confusiasm. And I agree.</p>

				<p>Hong Kong is still building of course. It hasn't stood still despite initial impressions. There are lots of new buildings. And there are 161 new skyscrapers currently approved. Wow. Where are they going to put them?</p>

				<p>We also appear to be the only people who walk anywhere here. Everyone else has already learned how futile it is to try. At first it was unreal walking around on these slopes and fun to get a bit of exercise. But a few days in and I find it a real pain in the arse. There are steps everywhere and escalators to move you up and down the levels. But no lifts. We have a two year old who walks a bit but who needs to be carried a lot more and ideally lie in a buggy so he can grab some sleep. I've taken to carrying the buggy plus Freddie up and down the stairs. It's exhausting.</p>

				<p>The pavements aren't really meant for walking on either. They tend to suddenly disappear and you find yourself standing at the side of a dual carriage way, 200 feet above the road you're meant to be on.</p>

				<p>Easily the best thing about Hong Kong has been meeting up with old friends and family. Charlotte lives here with her hubby. We’ve known Charlotte for over 20 years, on and off and Martin, less well, but since New York, a lifetime ago too. They have given us tips about where to spend our time, they have invited us into their home and even cooked for us. Granny has also been with us this week. Her first time in Asia and we’ve exhausted her, thrown her into the chaos that is Hong Kong. I hope she’s enjoyed it. We have. And tonight she gives us a precious gift - babysitting our kids so we can escape into Central for a night out. I can’t wait. Safe travels back to London, Granny.</p>

				<p>We've only had a week here, and maybe I'm just getting old, but Hong Kong isn't doing it for me. Maybe once, at an earlier stage of life, with no kids it would have been fun. But not now. It doesn't have enough of the things I value - space, clean air, sunshine, greenery, pavements.</p>

				<p>But maybe a Friday night out, drinking in the neon, will change my mind...</p>
