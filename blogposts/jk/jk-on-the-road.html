				<h1>On the road</h1>

				<p>A magical world. A lost world. A real life Jurassic park. A land full of robots, with a love of coffee. We're in outdoorland. And it's pretty and rugged and beautiful.</p>

				<p>I love road trips. I'm not sure what you’re supposed to do on them though. You just drive. And drive. And chat some. But in getting from A to B, there are always adventures to be had along the way. I guess that’s what I like. The uncertainty. The lack of plans.</p>

				<p>I’ve done some road trips before. Across Europe. Thousands of miles in just a few days. But not with my family. With friends. Sharing the driving. And my transport was somewhat different to my current steed. Fewer seats. A few more horses.</p>

				<p>But what better place to do our first proper family road trip than in New Zealand? A country with great views around every corner. If you were to stop to take a photo every time there was a worthy vista,  you’d never get anywhere.</p>

				<p>We hit the M1. The major road in the north. Exit 431 passes by - this must be a long road - and it’s a normal motorway, like back home. Soon enough though, we are veering onto the M2. And things change. This is a single lane highway with limited overtaking - think Cornwall. Very rapidly in New Zealand you get far from the madding crowd. A big country with very few people. We’ve been to cities with more people than in the whole of this country. In fact, most of the cities we’ve been to have had more people. We’re travelling from Auckland to the Coromandel Peninsula. A holiday destination for the locals. Popular in Summer. In May though (like November back home), people think we’re a bit mad. The place is known for its amazing beaches. So obviously we head there in winter.</p>

				<p>But so far, New Zealand has surprised us. The weather had been English summer-esque. Twenty degrees. Blue skies. Only one day of rain so far. Great driving weather. Great beach weather. Let’s hope it holds out.</p>

				<p>The conversation on the road is not exactly Kerouac. The kids alternately fall asleep and feel sick. Eventually, we need to stop. We find a lovely spot next to the beach, in the sun and order some food. When we look up, we see the building next to us (10 yards away) is the public toilet. Occasional wafts of ‘public lav’ hit us as we eat. Nice. I guess not all adventures are perfect. But it’s food (sort of) and there is a kids’ playground to burn off some energy before we head off.</p>

				<p>At first it’s like driving through the English countryside. Rolling green hills, but with different plants. More tropical if anything. Like a warmer England. Then we hit the hills and boy do I wish I was driving something else. It’s switchback after switchback. Like an Alpine climb. I feel an urge to get on a bike. Cycling up and down these roads takes me back to my self-powered road trip through the Alps last Summer, with the boys. Good times.</p>

				<p>It’s stunning here. But it takes forever. The kilometres crawl past. The Landcruiser wallowing its way to the top. Vomit ever present, in thought, word and (not yet) deed. We approach our destination at sunset and are hit by too many postcard views to ignore. We stop to take a few envy photos before trying to find our home for the night. The instructions are a bit vague. Pass a lane on the left and then ‘count to 30’ and the entrance is on the right. I’m not sure that works well at all speeds?</p>

				<p>We stop at a farm track trying to work out where to go. We decide that it can’t be this single track farm lane. Fifty yards up the road is another farm track. This time, there is a small sign and it’s our home. The ‘road’ is no different to the one we dismissed. A roughly hewn kilometre later and I’m glad we’re in an old beast of a 4x4.</p>

				<p>The road ends on a cliff. And perched above it is our home. The sun is setting. We can see perhaps 20 km in all directions. And the view is full of beach and sea and sky. Wow. The road trip pauses here for a couple of days. The kids are gonna love the beaches. I’ll tolerate them. Maybe do some exercise for a change. But as I crack open the first beer of the night, I’m looking forward to leaving already.</p>

				<p>I love a good road trip. And this one’s set to run and run.</p>
