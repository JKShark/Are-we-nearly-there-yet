				<h1>Playing away</h1>

				<p>It’s so great to watch your kids play (I mean my kids, of course. Me watching your kids would be odd). In the right mood, they can invent almost anything to entertain themselves. And they forget themselves. Forget about us. They are in the zone. In the flow.</p>

				<p>I think play gives us pleasure because it's authentic. It's the real me. The real you. My kids are not trying to be anyone else. Not trying to impress anyone. They are just having fun. Shortly, of course, they’ll be fighting about something or other and they’ll be tears. But right now, they’re enjoying themselves.</p>

				<p>I wonder what activity we can do as adults to help us achieve the same state. To take us away from the everyday. To allow us to forget our troubles and be authentic. It’s got to be good for you. Perhaps that's what sport is for?</p>

				<p>Every game we play as adults pushes us towards that feeling. Whether it’s physically demanding like tennis or mentally tough like poker, they don’t give us any room for thought about anything else. All that matters is the matter at hand. The reaction sports are probably the easiest form of escape. Tennis, cricket and to some extent football and hockey don’t give you much time for thinking. But maybe that makes them the easy option? There’s no effort required to escape. The other problem is age. These are sports for young men. Fitness, speed, reaction times all slow down with age (unless you fight hard against the great fight). What about old blokes? What can we do?</p>

				<p>I’ve done a lot of long distance aerobic races/trips/adventures. These have different challenges. You have a lot of time to think. Too much time. The overriding thought is one of wanting to stop. Immediately. Right now. And the struggle is to keep going. Resist that urge. I am beginning to find this less of a challenge, mentally at least. It is great to feel fit. I vaguely remember that feeling. But the challenge of not stopping isn’t so hard once you’ve conquered it once or twice. The challenge is resisting boredom. Audio books, music and mental puzzles along the way help to pass the time but I don’t think they really help you to relax, forget and zone out.</p>

				<p>I used to play a lot of golf. Haven’t for ages (other than a hilarious, if disastrous, round with Llama) but I am being drawn to it once more. Usually I play a round, enjoy it and then wonder why I don’t play more. But this time, I crave a game despite not having played recently. I haven’t had that experience of striking a perfect shot (even one usually does it). The feeling that every golfer has had - "If only I could do that every time, I could be really good at this game."</p>

				<p>No, I am being drawn to the mental challenge. It’s a long game. Four hours. Filled with walking, talking and inactivity. But with the need to focus and concentrate for periods like no other sport I’ve ever played. If you enter the golf course with an ounce of ego, it will be your undoing. I should know. I’ve done it hundreds of times. You cannot try hard in golf and get results. You cannot be lazy either and you cannot not try. You need to forget yourself. Get out of your own way. And let the ancient part of your brain do the doing for once. It’s very difficult to do. Certainly difficult to do it regularly. On demand.</p>

				<p>Meditation is all the rage these days. It’s been rebranded ‘mindfulness' so as to avoid the mystic hippy associations. And no, I’m not going to complete the caricature image of a traveller for you by saying that it’s my new thing (though I have got the long hair, beard, bracelets, sarong…maybe I  should try meditation?). But if <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/is-mindfullness-actually-good-for-you/6462670">mindfulness</a> is good for you, and it’s all about quieting the conscious self, then I can’t think of a better practice than playing golf.</p>

				<p>I have a round booked next week. On my own. In the rain. As I’m freezing my arse off trying to grip my clubs, I’ll try and remember this theory of mine and report back.</p>

				<p>I’m keen to play. Given I’m getting old now, I’m thinking golf might be my game. I need to be able to justify spending hours and hours away from the family practicing and improving. And of course justifying a whole raft of spending on new gadgets, clothes and equipment. I was thinking of telling Helen that it will make me a better person, a better father, a better husband.</p>

				<p>What do you think? Will she buy it?</p>
