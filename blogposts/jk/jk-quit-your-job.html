				<h1>Why you should quit your job and travel the world</h1>

				<p>I love ideas. The ability to come up with something new is wonderful. I've always envied people who can do that. New gadgets, new solutions, even new adverts. Maybe I’ve should have been a ‘creative' all these years?</p>

				<p>I don’t believe you need to be special to be creative (though you’ll never buy anything that I’ve painted, drawn or sung). Anyone can have ideas. They may not all be great, but idea generation, problem solving is inside all of us. And it’s a vital skill that I’ve let lapse. Being busy with work, kids and stuff is not conducive to thinking. It’s easy to be a busy fool - I should know.</p>

				<p>I came across an <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine">article</a> recently that said idea generation is like a muscle, and needs exercising regularly. I like the sound of that and I’ve decided to give it a go. I'm going to write down ten ideas every day for six months. They don’t have to be good ideas. In fact, they can’t be, unless you’re a genius - that would be 1,800 good ideas. It’s not going to be easy. In fact, its hard enough coming up with a topic let alone 10 ideas about that topic.</p>

				<p>I’d like to say that the idea for a career break was long planned and well thought out, but it wasn’t. Now that I’ve had some time to think about it, I’m going to backfill my empty planning and tell you why I ought to have decided to take time away from work, and why you should too.</p>

				<p>The great plan for modern life was created during the industrial revolution: go to school, learn to learn, learn to sit still and obey orders, get a job in a factory, obey orders, be loyal, get promoted, have kids, retire, die (youngish). Quite a lot has changed since then. But the general plan for life hasn’t.</p>

				<p>Most of us no longer work in a factory or need to. Yet we still follow the same old ways. Follow the path, obey your boss, sit still. Not great preparation for the job market today with flexible working, remote working, computers, social media, industries being reinvented all the time (who’d have thought Kodak would no longer exist 20 years ago?). Obeying orders and being loyal at work is no longer enough. It no longer works. You need to be creative, to solve problems, to do other people’s jobs as well as yours - there is no defined path. No careers any more.</p>

				<p>And we're living longer and longer. The age of retirement is creeping up but no way near as quickly as life expectancy. So we have perhaps 20 years of retirement to look forward to (and to fund). I haven’t even been working for 20 years. I can’t imagine what to do for that long. But if you follow the ‘plan’, then you work for 50 years, following orders, obeying, saving, to look forward to doing all the things you’ve always wanted to in your retirement - when you’re 70 years old! What if you don’t make it that far? All that being good and following the plan and you never get to do the fun bit?</p>

				<p>So have lots of career breaks along the way. That’s my answer. A year out may seem like a long time (and it is for you) but for your work ‘colleagues’ back at base, it will fly by in a swirl of emails. You’ll be back before you know it. Refreshed. Having had the time of your life. Having had the retirement trip you’ve always been looking forward to.</p>

				<p>You may even have learned something. Changed. Decided your old career no longer interests you. Who knows?</p>

				<p>That's what I should have thought about a year ago, before I quit work. I didn’t. But I think it makes sense now. So build up the courage, go and talk to your boss and quit.</p>

				<p>You know you want to.</p>
