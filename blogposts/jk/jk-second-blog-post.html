				<h1>Why write a Blog? 2</h1>

				<p>Deciding to write a blog is a very strange experience. Agreed, it's not hard to do. There are thousands if not millions out there. But why do it in the first place?</p>

				<p>It's not clear whether the greatest challenge will be home-schooling, the travelling or just being together. But it's going to be fun finding out.</p>

				<p>Part of the education process is for our children to chronicle their journey. For them to practice their writing, for their schoolfriends to keep in touch and for friends and family to know what we are up to and where in the world we are. So they are going to be writing a weekly update on the site. Hopefully I'll be able to include photos that they have taken themselves too.</p>

				<p>I'm also going to be writing a blog. So that we can remember the trip. All the little details that time will erase. To record the highs and lows of the journey. I've not written anything other than business documents for over 20 years. Initially, I've no doubt it'll be rubbish. But I hope the practice of writing every day will help. At the very least I have to improve (don't I?).</p>
