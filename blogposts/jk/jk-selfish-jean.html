				<h1>The selfish jean</h1>

				<p>Without much planning or forethought, I'd ended up with a day to myself. There was no pondering what I should do. I was booked up. Busy from dawn till dusk.</p>

				<p>First, I was off to climb the bridge. A gift from my parents. I don’t know if it’s unique but it’s certainly an unusual thing to do. To be able to do. The storm had stopped 12 hours before I was due up there. I wouldn’t have gone up in the storms. Though 100 brave souls did apparently. Madness.</p>

				<p>I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it. It’s so obviously a tourist trap. Overpriced. Safety focused (probably a good thing). Any initial romance (the idea of scaling the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge) has been squeezed out by the health and safety monkeys. It’s all about process. An hour after I check in and we’re still getting dressed.</p>

				<p>But Scott, our guide, is a legend. He’s done 3,800 bridge climbs and his patter is down pat. We have headphones on so he can chat to us and the history lesson is absorbing. Once we set off, everything changes. The weather clears up. The sun comes out. And Scott’s dad jokes entertain me, if not the bemused Chinese tourists behind me.</p>

				<p>And the views are truly stunning. A unique perspective on the city. A great place to reflect. There's no hurry. We're given time. Flying high above the harbour. I get some great photos. If only I wasn't in them. Wearing my prison outfit and harness.</p>

				<p>When I land, time has flown and I've no time to return to the roost before my next adventure. So I head to a pub. On my own. I've always wondered who goes to a pub on their own. Such a social place to be alone. But maybe they're just like me. Just wanting some food and a beer. The oldest pub in Sydney sees me right. Always worth warming up for a tour of Sydney's craft breweries with a pint. Kind of like stretching before a run. I feel ready now.</p>

				<p>I meet Dave a bit later in Surrey Hills. A former telecoms engineer turned beer aficionado and local legend. He's bald with a beard, of course.</p>

				<p>I've never done a brewery tour before. Never been to a brewery before. But I wanted to know more about the craft beer scene here which is booming. And I do like beer. We went to 3 breweries in 3 hours. We tried perhaps 15 different beers. It's a bit like wine tasting. Except you must swallow the product (it's important to let the bitter hops hit your throat apparently). Even with mini pint glasses, I was drunk before we left our first stop. There’s trouble ahead...</p>

				<p><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.younghenrys.com/">Young Henrys</a> was my favourite. Beer brewed on site and then served straight to punters. As fresh as it can get. The owners wandering about and working while we sat and talked about malt and hops and pale ale. Beer bores. I was lacking a proper beard and tattoos to truly fit in. But my beer belly gave me permission to linger.</p>

				<p>I turned up at home just before our guests arrived for dinner. I was quite 'happy' by this stage. The kids claimed to have missed me. Sweet. 8 hours apart and I was needed. Though I wasn't able to provide much more than a big hug.</p>

				<p>I did provide much mirth over dinner. My role as object of derision and uselessness played to perfection. It was only one day. A day to myself. A day spent with strangers. A day which ended up with friends.</p>

				<p>As I fell asleep on the sofa to the sound of Helen clearing up I could reflect on a day well spent. New friends made. New beer drunk. And a small dark hole to be climbed out of tomorrow. But that could wait.</p>

				<p>I turned over and hugged my favourite <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/384/">growler</a> to sleep.</p>
