				<h1>My Australia project</h1>
				
				<p>1. Where is Australia?</br>
					Australia is on the bottom of the world next to the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean, in the southern hemisphere.</p>

				<p>2. How big is Australia?</br>
					Australia is 7,692,024 km&sup2; which is about 60 times bigger than England.</p>
				
				<p>3. How many people live in Australia today?</br>
					The population of Australia is 22,262,501 people which is 3 times less than the UK.</p>

				<p>4. Where do most people live?</br>
					People mostly live on the coast. Between 80% and 90% of Australians live within 50 km of the ocean.</p>
		
				<p>5. What is the capital of Australia? Where is it?</br>
					The capital city of Australia is Canberra. It is located on the south east of Australia in New South Wales.</p>

				<p>6. Who rules / governs Australia?</br>
					Australia is part of a democracy and its prime minister is Tony-Abbott since 2013. It is also a monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II (our Queen) as Australian's head of state.</p>
					
				<p>7. What does 'indigenous' mean?</br>
					Indigenous means originating from a particular region or country; native.</p>

				<p>8. How long have people lived in Australia?</br>
					The common answer is 40,000 years.</p>

				<p>9. When did Britons discover Australia? Who discovered it? Where did he/she land?</br>
					Captain James Cook was the first Briton to land in Australia on the 28th April 1770. He landed on Kurnell Peninsula Headland in Botany Bay.</p>

				<p>10. Describe what happened between Britons and the Indigenous people. Is it the same today?</br>
					The Britons and the Aborigines first fought several months after the landing of the First Fleet on 26 January 1788 and the last clashes were as late as 1934. They fought because the Britons wanted to claim Australia while the Aborigines wanted to have Australia to themselves so they could live in peace. It is not the same today because the Britons and the Aborigines now live side by side in harmony.</p>

				<p>11. What language is spoken in Australia today? Is it the only language widely spoken?</br>
					About 80% of Australians speak English while some indigenous people speak Aboriginal languages, Tasmanian languages, Torres Straight Island languages. Minority languages are Mandarin chinese (1.6%), Italian (1.4%), Arabic (1.3%), Greek (1.3%) and Cantonese (1.2%).</p>

				<p>12. What is a convict?</br>
					 A convict is a person guilty of criminal offense judged by jury or a judge in a court of law.</p>
				
				<p>13. Why are convicts important in the modern history of Australia?</br>
					Convicts are important because if there was a British criminal, instead of going to jail, a convict would be sent to Australia. The convicts were therefore the first settlers. Woman convicts were the most useful as they could be wives and mothers. Whatever anyone's crime, they were employed according to their skills - as brick makers, carpenters, nurses, servants, cattlemen, shepherds and farmers.</p>

				<p>14. What is ANZAC day and when is it?</br>
					ANZAC day is a commemoration of the time Australia battled against Turkey and Australia won. It is celebrated on 25th April.</p>

				<p>15. What are YOUR top five things to do in Sydney and why?</br>
					My five favourite things to do in Sydney are:</br>
					- Surfing because I enjoy it and it is fun.</br>
					- Taronga Zoo because I like seeing all the animals I have never seen before.</br>
					- The Opera House because it is so beautiful.</br>
					- The ferries because I like getting around by boat.</br>
					- The beaches because I love surfing and bodyboarding and swimming.
