				<h1>Dubai is Awesome!</h1>

				<p>Dubai is always sunny, even in winter, in the coldest month of the year, it is really hot. People are always building things. There are lots of cranes everywhere.</p>

				<p>They have the biggest shopping mall in the world, the tallest building in the world and the fastest lift in the world. The <a class="m-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/">Burj Khalifa</a> was so tall that I thought the lift might fly out of the top of the tower. When you looked down from the tower, you could see the whole of Dubai, as far as the desert and a lot of houses.</p>

				<p>We have a waterpark next to our hotel called Aquaventure. The slides there were really fun. You went almost straight down and then up and you got splashed by lots of water. Some of them were even in pitch black tunnels. They could spiral and I almost went upside down in one of the tunnels. You had to sit in big hoops on all of the slides and on one bit I forgot to lift my bottom up and banged my bottom and got big bumps and bruises. After lunch, I went on the water rapids which were really rough and bumpy. It sent me spinning round and round. I got splashed loads and almost fell in the water once or twice. I didn’t want to leave but we could come back again every day if we wanted to. We went with our friends the next day and went on lots of fun rides. Me and Jack, who is my friend, went on Shark Attack - a slide that went curly-wurly in pitch black but finally came out into a glass tunnel which was in a tank filled with sharks and manta rays!</p>

				<p>On Christmas Eve, I was a bit worried that Santa hadn’t got our letters as we were in Dubai. But he had. That evening, we had two of Santa’s elves come in and tuck us in and read us a story.</p>

				<p>The next morning, I woke up and found my presents at the end of my bed. Once everybody had woken up, we started to open them. I got some <a class="m-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lalaloopsy.com/">LaLa Loopsy dolls</a> and a Monster High bracelet making kit. Christmas Day was really unusual as we went to the beach and we went swimming in the pool. I haven’t done that before. We had special Christmas lunch. Santa visited and gave us a little chocolate bar and gave Freddie a balloon.</p>

				<p>One of the funniest things in our hotel is an ice cream shop where the waiters who are getting your ice cream use two scoops to throw it from one hand to the other and then throw it to the other end of the shop to another member of staff who would catch it in a paper cup and then throw it back.</p>

				<p>The highlight of the week was that one day me and Mummy went to Dolphin Bay, a special place where you can swim with dolphins. Our dolphin was called Blade. We were all in the water with Blade and when it was my turn, he kissed me, then I danced with him. I swam out into more open space. Where I put my hands out and Blade swam upside down towards me. Once he got to me, I grabbed onto his dorsal fins and he swam up to the shore still upside down while carrying me. It was really awesome. I wanted to do it again.</p>
