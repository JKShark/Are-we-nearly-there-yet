				<h1>Frozen fantasy</h1>

				<p>The night before Disneyland, I simply couldn't sleep. I was so ridiculously excited because I could hear all the rides buzzing and whirring.</p>

				<p>My first step into Disneyland was out of this world. I could have screamed. The theme was Frozen (my favourite movie!!) Anna, Elsa and Olaf were everywhere. Tokyo Disneyland Station and Cinderella's Castle were towering high above me. It was going to be the best day ever!!!</p>

				<p>First we sprinted to Space Mountain, a rollercoaster in the dark. Daddy loved it but I hated it. It was too scary - pitch black. It was extremely disappointing and I was in tears. Daddy had to work hard to convince me that the next ride would be better.</p>

				<p>We headed to Star Tours;  a 4-D ride where we sat in a "spaceship" with a 3-D screen in front of us. It felt like we were really flying through space, especially when Darth Vader appeared out of nowhere and used The Force to shake our ship.</p>

				<p>Next up was a calmer ride - Snow White's Adventures. A wicked witch offered me an apple. I refused and she tried to push a rock on top of our cart. Fortunately she didn't succeed.</p>

				<p>We went on many more rides, but my favourite ride was Big Thunder Mountain - another roller-coaster, but outside this time. It was a train that went up and down extraordinarily fast. I felt as though my stomach had been left behind.</p>

				<p>The park was horrendously busy. The queues for everything were gigantic, like snakes twisting and turning for miles. The queue for popcorn was so long that I went on a Merry-go-round and when I got back to the queue, Mummy still wasn't at the front!</p>

				<p>Everyone was wearing Disney hats. I have never seen so many Minnie and Mickey mouse headbands. All ages joined in the fun; I saw a Granny wearing an Olaf hat and Daddy wore a Monsters Inc furry helmet.</p>

				<p>The finale was a big light show projected on to Cinderella's Castle with lots of Disney songs (luckily in English). I gIeefully joined in. It was amazing! I didn't want the day to end.</p>

				<p>The only bad thing about the day was that some rides were in Japanese! I'll have to persuade Daddy to take us to Disneyland Florida next time!</p>
