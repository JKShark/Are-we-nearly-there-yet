				<h1>Sweetie factory</h1>

				<p>We spent the day on the Mekong river delta. The delta is where the river splits up into lots of fingers as it gets close to the sea. The locals call it the nine dragon delta.</p>

				<p>We visited a sweetie factory on the river. It didn’t look like a normal factory. It was more like a wooden tent. It didn’t have any doors and only two walls, one at each end. We didn’t know what we were being taken to see but our guide told us it was a sweet factory.</p>

				<p>The first thing we saw was a machine for hollowing out coconuts. They took the strips of coconut out of its shell and melted them into a sticky gooey mess. Then they flavoured it with chocolate, strawberry or peanuts. They rolled out this mixture into long strips to dry. This became little rectangles of coconut toffee which they wrapped in edible rice paper. It was very chewy and tasted like you had popped a whole coconut into your mouth. I don’t normally like coconut but I loved these.</p>

				<p>We also saw some popped rice being made which is like popcorn but made out of rice rather than corn. To make it, the man that showed us poured some black sand into a scorching hot metal bowl which was being heated over a fire. Once the sand got really hot, he tipped some rice into it. Almost immediately, the rice started popping until it was white and crispy. Then he took it off the fire and tipped it all into a big sieve and shook all the sand out onto the floor. Once he had made sure there was no sand left, he took the rice to be flavoured and coloured, with favours like strawberry, chocolate and orange.</p>

				<p>It was the strangest factory I have ever been to but I loved the sweets!</p>
