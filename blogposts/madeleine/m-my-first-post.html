				<h1>San Francisco!</h1>

				<p>As we got into San Francisco city I realised it was very busy and that I felt really tired, since we'd just flown from England and gotten jetlagged, therefore our day was eight hours longer!</p>                                             
				<p>Once we’d arrived at the Clift Hotel (where we were staying) and unpacked a little bit, we set out to find somewhere to eat.</p>

				<p>As the food arrived I wanted to do nothing but sleep. Unfortunately I couldn’t so when we got to the hotel I was so thankful that I just went straight to bed.</p>

				<p>The next day, we took a cable car up a really steep hill. It went almost straight up. The cable car was very old with no doors so we had to hold on tightly. Once the cable car finally stopped, we were at the sea. We started walking but we went the wrong way!</p>

				<p>Eventually we made it to a famous old chocolate factory, called Ghirardelli’s. There were chocolates of all types. We ordered an enormous ice cream sundae and sat eating it looking at the island prison of Alcatraz.</p>

				<p>Visiting Alcatraz was one of the highlights of the trip. We went there on a boat. The prison was very dark and gloomy – it wouldn’t have been nice to be trapped there. The worst thing about it would have been when you were allowed outside, seeing everybody back on the mainland doing normal things and enjoying themselves. Three people actually managed to escape by stealing spoons from the dining hall and tunneling through the wall. One of them died. Nobody knows what happened to the other two. Maybe they drowned. Maybe they are still alive today.</p>

				<p>One of the main reasons for the trip was to visit my cousins, Toby and Harriet. We saw them lots of times. We watched a basketball match with them, met up for brunch and went trick-or-treating with them.</p>

				<p>Personally, my favourite bit was going to the <a class="m-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.americangirl.com/index.php">American Girl</a> shop with Harriet. The shop was gigantic. It had two levels of dolls and clothes. In the end, after much discussion, I finally bought Josephina, a historical doll and a matching nightdress for me and her.</p>

				<p>Afterwards, we went upstairs and had dinner in the American Girl restaurant where they provided plates and cups for the dolls! I could have spent days in there.</p>

				<p>On Halloween, I dressed up as <a class="m-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.monsterhigh.com/en-us/characters/frankie-stein">Frankie Stein</a> from Monster High.</p>
				<img src="../../images/blog_photos/FrankieStein.jpg">  

				<p>We went to Toby’s Dad’s boss’s house and went out ‘trick or treating’ in a huge group. The roads were closed to cars and there were thousands of people walking the streets. Everybody dressed up – even the grown ups! Daddy dressed up as <a class="m-link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_Puft_Marshmallow_Man">Stay Puft</a> from Ghostbusters. I called him “Marshmallow Man”!</p>

				<p>Overall, San Francisco was awesome. The weather was really sunny and I liked being able to walk around with flip flops on, knowing it was cold at home. I was sad to leave to come home.</p>
