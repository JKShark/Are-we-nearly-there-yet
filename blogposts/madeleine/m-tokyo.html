				<h1>Tokyo</h1>

				<p>On our first day in Japan, we did Karaoke. This is where you sing into microphones in front of a TV which has all the words and the music on it. In Japan, they have whole buildings just for Karaoke. I loved singing along to Taylor Swift. I sang really loudly because no-one else can hear you or see you, so you can sing as loudly as you want!</p>

				<p>We also went to Kidzania in Tokyo, a place where kids rule! You can get jobs for the day and get paid with Kidzos which you can spend in the shop. I was a nurse, a pilot and a baker. For fun, I paid for a make-over in the beauty salon. Kidzania was way better than I thought - I really want to go again. In the end, we made 160 Kidzos but the only things I could afford were rubbish so we kept the money to spend next time!</p>

				<p>We visited an amazing pet shop. It was filled with frilly dresses and coats for dogs. There were even wedding dresses! There were some very cute, tiny fluffy little dogs to buy. My favourite  dog was a tiny smooth black puppy - as big as a my pencil case.</p>

				<p>We took the fastest train in the world (the Shinkansen) to the countryside. We stayed in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn. As soon as we got there, we changed into special Japanese robes and coats which the hotel provided. Everybody had to wear them all the time. We hired a private onsen, a natural hot spring bath which was outside, so that we could all be together. In the main onsens, boys and girls were separate and you had to be naked (we went in those the next morning, when it was snowing).</p>

				<p>We ate dinner sat on the floor on a very low table. The food was unusual. There was a lot of fish. Sometimes it was raw and sometimes it was cooked. Dinner came on one big tray with lots of dishes on the tray. Lots more courses came. It was like a buffet being served to you. You also have to use chop sticks (I’m getting the hang of it). I liked the battered lotus root; I didn’t like the look of Daddy’s little tiny fish.</p>

				<p>So far, Japan is busy but very organised. There aren’t as many scooters as in Vietnam. There are lots of different customs; you often have to take your shoes off to enter a room and the Japanese often bow before entering rooms - even on the trains! Lots of people working here (like taxi drivers) wear white gloves. People like to dress up in kimonos. I have learned how to write Madeleine in Japanese and the symbol for ‘big’ (it’s like when you stretch out your arms and make yourself as big as possible).</p>
